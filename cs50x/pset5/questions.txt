0.  It is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known
as silicosis.
1.  It gives information about the resources usaged by the variable 'who'.
2.  16
3.  To reduce memory usage.
4.  The for loop reads a character from the file. It then checks if it is an
alphabet or an apostrophe. If it is, then it simply appends it to the end of the
string. If it is a number, it truncates the entire word and starts with the next
one. Otherwise, if the index happens to be a positive integer, '\0' is appended
at the the end of the word, and checked if it is misspelled. The 'words' and
'misspellings' counters are updated accordingly.
5.  To ensure that the length of words stays under LENGTH. In other words, a
word longer than LENGTH is simply discarded.
6.  So that the name of the dictionary file is not modified in any case, not 
even accidentaly.
7.  I used a hash table to implement spell-checker. Every node of the hash table
has a word of maximum length as LENGTH, and a pointer of the same struct type
pointing to the next node in the hash table.
8.  It took 0.14s to check the text file austinpowers.txt.
9.  No changes.
10. My hashing function could be improved to reduce the time taken in loading
the dictionary.
